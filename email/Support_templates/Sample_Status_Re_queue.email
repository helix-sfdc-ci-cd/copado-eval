Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thanks for reaching out to Helix!  During the final quality check stage of the sequence process an issue was noted that necessitated pulling a new sample from the saliva you provided.  This is usually due to not enough DNA recovered.  

We're in the last stages of the sequencing process with the new sample and should be transferring your data to National Geographic soon.  When your results are available, an email message will be sent.

Thanks for your patience and stay tuned!
