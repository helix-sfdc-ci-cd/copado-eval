Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thanks for reaching out to Helix!  In regards to your sample status, we take every opportunity to ensure results are accurate.  However, each sample is unique and occasionally samples require additional time in the lab to deliver the high level of results you expect.

We hope to have results available soon and thank you for your patience!
