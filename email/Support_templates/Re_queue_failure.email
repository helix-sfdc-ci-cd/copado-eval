Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for reaching out.  A sample may be re-queued for sequencing due to technical reasons related to the lab process that have no impact on the quality or reliability of your results.  DNA sequencing only requires a small portion from your original sample, safely allowing our lab to return to your original sample and draw additional material as needed. Sample quality is not affected by this process and thus a new sample is not required at this time.  We have every confidence your results will be delivered within 4-5 weeks if not sooner and sincerely thank you for your patience!
